# Dinner With Death

## Why?
I like text adventure games. As well as write stories in my free time. So it felt like the most direct path for an app to build. In conjunction I also wanted something easy. I didn't want to get lost in the sauce and be unable to finish because I wasn't up to par. Turns out however that I greatly underestimated myself and now I'm left with a project I can't wait to get back to and increase the size of.
